  summary: 'VA-API (Video Acceleration API) user mode driver for Intel GEN Graphics family'

  description: |
    VA-API is an open-source library and API specification, which provides
    access to graphics hardware acceleration capabilities for video processing.
    It consists of a main library and driver-specific acceleration backends for
    each supported hardware vendor.

    The current video driver backend provides a bridge to the GEN GPUs through
    the packaging of buffers and commands to be sent to the i915 driver for
    exercising both hardware and shader functionality for video decode, encode,
    and processing.
